This PyCharm project is based on the information 
provided in the video "Python Full Course üêç (FREE)"
by Bro Code on YouTube. I've been using this video 
to learn the fundamentals of Python syntax and 
capabilities. This project is customized based on my
personal information and lines of code I thought would
be useful for me to write. I hope to look back on this
in the future to see how far I've come!
